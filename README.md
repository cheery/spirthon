# Python to SPIR-V Compiler

Translation from python bytecode to SPIR-V.

This might come out as something, or then not. It would be a shame to not try.

## Status

Ran regexes into the glslang source code to retrieve myself a machine readable specification. It went quite well. Now I need to write a decoder and an encoder.
