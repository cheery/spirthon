# Python to SPIR-V Compiler

Translation from python bytecode to SPIR-V.

This might come out as something, or then not. It would be a shame to not try.

## Status

I'm looking for SPIR-V tables to generate myself an instruction encoder/decoder. Preferably in .json -format. If I don't find any, I will run regexes into the glslang source code.
