# Python to SPIR-V Compiler

Translation from python bytecode to SPIR-V.

This might come out as something, or then not. It would be a shame to not try.

## Status

Made an instruction decoder and encoder that work from the specification I generated from glslang earlier. Now I need to adjust my translator prototype to use SPIR-V instructions.
